Added the controller package and implemented the PyramidSolitaireTextualController,
 which is tightly coupled with the PyramidSolitaireTextualView in order to manage the model.

Refactored BasicPyramidSolitaire's startGame method to add the buildBoard method, which constructs
 a board from the tempDeck.

Changed all private methods in BasicPyramidSolitaire to protected to allow them to be inherited/
  overridden by child classes.

Switched the calculation for a board that cannot be filled into a protected helper method,
  total spaces.
